# MERN Task Manager

### A full-stack Task Management application built using the MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node) architecture, fully containerized and hardened.

## the project uses Vite 6 and Tailwind 4, which are cutting-edge for 2026.

## Architecture Highlights:

1. Frontend: React served by Nginx (Alpine) running as a non-root user.

2. Backend: Node.js API built using Google Distroless for a minimal attack surface.

3. Reverse Proxy: Nginx handles routing to bypass CORS issues and secure the backend.

4. Database: MongoDB with persistent volumes and healthcheck-dependent startup.

## Prerequisites

   * For "mern.env" write :
    ```sh 
     MONGODB_URL=mongodb://admin:<psswd>@db:27017/mydb?authSource=admin
     ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET='Rj2S?RVe9[]8-dCS6A**&b5Tsg$gwbg~Bd{*QTK' (any-long-string)
